I had 2 meetings lined up within 90 minutes (one with slang, one usual update meeting as my at the time Job), I thought I’ll talk with slanglabs
                        for about 30 minutes and then rush off to the other location. 90 minutes later I was still sitting with slanglabs, I had missed the other meeting. A company that is actually making a useful product and not something that just seems
                        to be working, also a design thinking company. At first, they wanted to get some illustrations made for the website. When they first explained to me what they were doing, I was not aware of their achievements. I heard their product
                        idea the same way as I used to listen from a college friend when they wanted to jump on the “startup bandwagon”. Except here, as I listened to it the thing that came to my mind was this can actually be big, and a thing that we
                        use every day.“to me better voice based experiences are imminent. <strong>It sounded to me like an idea, you don’t think about whether it will work or not, but someone be able to pull this off.”</strong><br>to me better voice-based
                        experiences are imminent. It sounded to me like an idea, you don’t think about whether it will work or not, but someone be able to pull this off. And by the time they contacted me they had already made it work. So from the first
                        day, the pressure was on.&nbsp;I had planned that I will be finishing this job in 20–30 days and while doing this, I will also be working part-time at another place. But now because of this talk, I knew that I will have to give
                        all my time to this. The pressure was on. (although they never put it on me)I felt I was underprepared for the work. I felt like I should read everything written about making illustrations for tech companies, I think I read most
                        of what I could find on the internet and here on medium, of course, Meg Robichaud is one of the medium writers that stood out, read on how other companies have used illustrations, how their process was like.&nbsp;<br>Slack, Airbnb,
                        Shopify, medium, how they have used illustrations, in hopes that I will get some “Must avoid lists” or something. I did not get any list rather, that led me to read more, that made me curious to understand why people used illustrations
                        in the first place. But anyways I made a list of companies that used them and wrote down what is the purpose they are serving. Honestly, I was just clueless at this point, had no idea whether this list will help me or not, but
                        nothing else seems to&nbsp;I didn’t find any “must avoid” but one thing I learned from making that list is that the reason people were making a similar looking illustration for the for tech products was not just because they were
                        lazy, but because they wanted everything to match with the already established UI of the product. Since the modern UIs have gradients and curved Buttons, no borders on everything(in contrast to the Windows 98).<br>As pointed out
                        in these two articles below, The reason for such illustrations may also have been just the use of modern software.<a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2018/01/03/two-different-kinds-of-illustration/"><strong>Two Very Different Kinds of Illustration</strong></a><br>

                            href="https://www.subtraction.com/2018/01/03/two-different-kinds-of-illustration/"><em>In late December The New York Times published “ The Year in Illustration,” a round-up of the dozens of commissioned…</em>www.subtraction.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/@borism/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73"><strong>Why Do All Websites Look the Same?</strong></a><br>

                                are UX/UI designers only and they made illustrations with the tools that they use for all the other UI design work, things like Sketch or Invision, whereas an can start from paper and ink to Rorschach inkblots to collage
                                to photoshop drawings to adobe illustrator. if you want to learn by looking at some work like this inboard with apple store illustrations is a good source, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/khoi/app-store-editorial-illustrations/">https://www.pinterest.com/khoi/app-store-editorial-illustrations/</a>                                one of the problems with these illustrations is that not all of them can be used for tech, still have a look, if you are following this you’ll be able to pick out the suitable ones.<br></p>
